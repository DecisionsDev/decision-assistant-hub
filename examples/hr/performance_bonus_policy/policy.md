# Acme Corp Performance Bonus Policy
Acme Corp offers performance-based bonuses to recognize and reward contributions made by employees. Bonus amounts, eligibility, and payout timelines are determined by a combination of performance, role seniority, and organizational discretion.
## 1. General Eligibility
* Regular full-time employees are generally eligible for performance bonuses.
* Part-time, contract, or supplemental employees are **not normally eligible**, unless stated in their employment agreement or at management's discretion.
* Employees must be **actively employed** at the time of bonus distribution unless otherwise specified.
## 2. Performance Tiers
Performance is assessed annually through formal reviews. Employees are assigned one of the following performance tiers:
| Performance Tier        | Description                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Tier 1 – Exceptional    | Significantly exceeds expectations |
| Tier 2 – Strong         | Consistently exceeds expectations  |
| Tier 3 – Solid          | Meets expectations                 |
| Tier 4 – Developing     | Partially meets expectations       |
| Tier 5 – Unsatisfactory | Does not meet expectations         |
* Bonus eligibility begins at **Tier 2** and above.
* **Tier 3** employees may receive a bonus at manager discretion or during profitable quarters.
* **Tier 4** and **Tier 5** employees are generally not eligible.
## 3. Seniority and Bonus Multipliers
Bonus amounts are influenced by seniority level:
| Job Level                    | Bonus Multiplier Range   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Associate / Entry-Level      | 5% – 8% of base salary   |
| Mid-Level / Senior Associate | 8% – 12% of base salary  |
| Manager / Senior Manager     | 10% – 15% of base salary |
| Director+                    | 15% – 20% of base salary |
* The actual bonus percentage within each range is based on performance tier and business performance.
* Employees who were **promoted mid-cycle** may be evaluated based on their previous level if the review period does not reflect their new responsibilities.
## 4. Additional Considerations
* **Departmental budgets** may cap total bonus allocation regardless of individual performance.
* Employees on **performance improvement plans (PIPs)** during the year are **ineligible**, even if they move out of the plan prior to distribution.
* **Leaves of absence** (e.g., parental, medical) **do not automatically disqualify** an employee, but bonus amounts may be prorated based on duration of active service.
* **Bonus payouts are not guaranteed** and remain subject to executive approval and company profitability.
