## Decision Pathways

  Applicants meeting **all** of the following:
  - Credit score ≥ 720.
  - DTI ≤ 30%.
  - Employment history ≥ 24 months.
  - Loan amount ≤ 8× monthly income.

- **Automatic Decline** if:
  - Credit score < 600, **or**
  - DTI > 50%, **or**
  - Less than 12 months continuous employment **unless** co-signer with credit score ≥ 750 is provided.

- **Manual Review Required** if:
  - Any document is missing or inconsistent.
  - Applicant meets all base eligibility but fails to meet fast-approval criteria.
  - Credit score between 600–629 **and** income ≥ $4,000/month with DTI ≤ 35%.

## Special Considerations
- Self-employed applicants must provide at least two recent tax returns unless their credit score ≥ 750.
- Applicants with prior loan defaults in the past 3 years require manual review even if all other conditions are met.
- If both applicant and co-signer meet **fast approval** criteria, loan may be approved without further checks.
