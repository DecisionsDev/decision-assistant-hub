This policy outlines the expense approval workflow used at Acme Corp. It is based on **expense type**, **amount thresholds**, and the **requestor’s role**. All expenses must be submitted with appropriate documentation and routed for approval based on the tables and conditions below.
## 1. General Principles
* **Pre-approval** is required for expenses above defined thresholds.
* **Out-of-policy expenses** must include justification and may require exception approval.
* Expenses must be submitted within **30 days of the transaction date** to be eligible for reimbursement.
* Expense approvers cannot approve their own expenses or those of direct supervisors.
## 2. Routing Logic – Decision Table
| Expense Amount      | Expense Type       | Requestor Role | Required Approvers                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ≤ \$500             | Any                | Any            | Direct Manager                            |
| \$501 – \$2,000     | Travel, Meals      | Employee       | Direct Manager                            |
| \$501 – \$2,000     | Hardware, Software | Employee       | Manager + Department Head                 |
| \$2,001 – \$5,000   | Any                | Employee       | Department Head + Finance Representative  |
| \$2,001 – \$10,000  | Any                | Manager+       | Department Head + Finance + BU Controller |
| \$10,001 – \$25,000 | Any                | Any            | CFO or Delegate                           |
| > \$25,000          | Any                | Any            | CFO + CEO Approval                        |
> **Note**: The BU Controller is required only if the expense impacts multiple departments or business units.
## 3. Special Handling
### Travel & Entertainment
* International travel must be pre-approved regardless of cost.
* Alcohol expenses over \$100 must be justified and approved by a **Director-level or higher**.
### Software & Subscriptions
* New software purchases require a **Security review** and **IT sign-off**, even under \$2,000.
* Renewals of approved tools do not require re-evaluation if usage and cost are unchanged.
### Hardware
* All laptops, monitors, and phones must be purchased via **IT procurement channels**.
* Personal purchases are not reimbursable unless pre-approved due to business urgency.
## 4. Exceptions & Escalations
* Approvals delayed for over **7 business days** may be escalated to the next higher level.
* If an approver is unavailable for more than **5 consecutive business days**, their delegate may approve.
* Exceptions outside the routing logic require a written explanation and approval from **Finance and Legal**.
