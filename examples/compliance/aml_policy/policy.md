# Acme Corp Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance Policy
## 1. Transaction Monitoring
Acme Corp flags transactions for review based on **three core triggers**:
### Trigger Conditions
1. **Large Transactions**  
   - Any transfer or deposit over **\$10,000**.
2. **Unusual Patterns**  
   - Multiple transactions just below reporting thresholds (e.g., \$9,900 or \$3,000).  
   - Rapid movement of funds (inbound followed by outbound within 48 hours).
3. **Geographic Risk**  
   - Transactions involving **sanctioned or high-risk countries**.
> Any flagged transaction is reviewed by compliance. Flagging does **not** imply wrongdoing.
## 2. Customer Risk Classification
Customers are classified into **two levels**:
| Risk Level | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **Standard** | Verified identity, domestic activity, predictable transactions. |
| **Elevated** | High-risk industry, foreign wires, incomplete KYC, or unusual transaction behavior.
> Compliance may override classification based on alerts or judgment.
## 3. Review and Escalation
| Risk Level | Review Type |
|------------|-------------|
| **Elevated** | Manual review of all flagged transactions. |
| **Standard** | Automated monitoring; manual review only if flagged. |
- Validated patterns (e.g., payroll) may be whitelisted.
- Escalations may result in:
  - Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)
